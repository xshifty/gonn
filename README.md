# GoNN - Go Neural Network
## A simple neural network written in Go for learning purpose

### Examples

Check the `examples` folder for some examples of how to use the library.
The examples are split in pairs of two main features of the library:

- Training a network
- Predicting with a trained network

For example, the `examples/sum-train` folder contains the code to train a network to sum two numbers, while the `examples/sum-predict` folder contains the code to predict the sum of two numbers with a trained network.
Running it will generate a checkpoint file that will serve as our network model (in this example `sum-relu-checkpoint.gob.gz`).

The second folder, `examples/sum-predict`, contains the code to predict the sum of two numbers with a trained network.
It will load the checkpoint file generated by the training example (`sum-relu-checkpoint.gob.gz`) and use it to predict the sum of two numbers.

#### Running the examples

Please, always run the train example before running the predict example.

Running sum training:
```bash
go run examples/sum-train/main.go
```

It will train the model and save it in a checkpoint file called `sum-relu-checkpoint.gob.gz`.

To run the sum prediction example:
```bash
go run examples/sum-predict/main.go
```
